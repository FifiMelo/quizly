Then 2 is added to b then the remainder is again calculated when divided by b, which still gives 2. After that 2 is subtracted from b and the remainder is calculated after dividing by b, which now gives us -3. This -3 is then multiplied with b and the remainder is calculated after dividing with b, which gives 1. Lastly, 1 to the power b is calculated and the remainder with b gives 0 after the division. So, the final result is 0."}]
